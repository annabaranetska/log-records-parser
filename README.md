# log-records-parser
My solution of the coding assignment for an interview.

## Running from command line
In the folder of the project the log-parser-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar can be found.
The file can be executed by
```
java -jar log-parser-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar PATHFILE
```
command run in the project folder with the PATHFILE being the path to logfile.txt

## Issues and comments

I highly appreciate the opportunity to participate in this stage of the interview! 
<br>Unfortunately, I've met some issues with creating a runnable **.jar file** for my project, which I didn't manage to resolve, although I have spent quite an amount of time working on it and looking for a solution.
<br>It is clear to me, that there is an issue with **Spring configurations**, which is probably somehow solved by Intellij Idea, as the projects runs there just fine, but cannot be solved in the .jar itself.
<br><br>I would really appreciate any remarks on my code. Thank you for your time and consideration!
